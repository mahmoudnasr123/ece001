                    <p><i><strong>An Operating system (OS)</strong></i> is a software which acts as an interface between the end user and computer hardware. Every computer must have a minimum of one OS to run other programs. An application like Chrome, MS Word, Games, etc needs some environment during which it'll run and perform its task. The OS helps you to speak with the pc without knowing the way to speak the computer's language. It is impossible for the user to use any computer or mobile device without having an OS.
                       Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources.
                       For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer – from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.

        <h2>Types of OS.</h2>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Single-tasking and multi-tasking</h4>
        <p>
            A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking OS allows quite one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is split between multiple processes. These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the OS . Multi-tasking could also be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the OS slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to every of the programs. Unix-like operating systems, like Solaris and Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, like AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by counting on each process to supply time to the opposite processes during a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking; 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x used preemptive multi-tasking.
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Single- and multi-user</h4>
        <p>
            Single-user operating systems haven't any facilities to differentiate users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem.[6] A multi-user OS extends the essential concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, like disc space , belonging to multiple users, and therefore the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at an equivalent time. Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and should also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Distributed</h4>
        <p>
            A distributed OS manages a gaggle of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be one computer, as all computations are distributed (divided amongst the constituent computers).
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Templated</h4>
        <p>
            In the distributed and cloud computing context of an OS, templating refers to making one virtual machine image as a guest OS , then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines. The technique is employed both in virtualization and cloud computing management, and is common in large server warehouses.
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Embedded</h4>
        <p>
            Embedded operating systems are designed to be utilized in embedded computer systems. They are designed to work on small machines with less autonomy (e.g. PDAs). They are very compact and very efficient intentionally , and are ready to operate with a limited amount of resources. Windows CE and Minix 3 are some samples of embedded operating systems.
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Real-time</h4>
        <p>
            A real-time OS is an OS that guarantees to process events or data by a selected moment in time. A real-time OS could also be single- or multi-tasking, but when multitasking, it uses specialized scheduling algorithms in order that a deterministic nature of behavior is achieved. Such an event-driven system switches between tasks supported their priorities or external events, whereas time-sharing operating systems switch tasks supported clock interrupts.
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Library</h4>
        <p>
            A library OS is one during which the services that a typical OS provides, like networking, are provided within the sort of libraries and composed with the application and configuration code to construct a unikernel: a specialized, single address space, machine image which will be deployed to cloud or embedded environments.

                    Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks, like a calculator. Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s, such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processing. Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960s. Hardware features were added, that enabled use of runtime libraries, interrupts, and parallel processing. When personal computers became popular in the 1980s, operating systems were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computers. In the 1940s, the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating systems. Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plugboards. These were special-purpose systems that, for example, generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper cards.

            After programmable general purpose computers were invented, machine languages (consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape) were introduced that sped up the programming process (Stern, 1981).[full citation needed] OS/360 was used on most IBM mainframe computers beginning in 1966, including computers used by the Apollo program. In the early 1950s, a computer could execute only one program at a time. Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited period and would arrive at a scheduled time with their program and data on punched paper cards or punched tape. The program would be loaded into the machine, and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashed. Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel lights. It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine, and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the universal Turing machine. Later machines came with libraries of programs, which would be linked to a user's program to assist in operations such as input and output and compiling (generating machine code from human-readable symbolic code). This was the genesis of the modern-day operating system. However, machines still ran a single job at a time. At Cambridge University in England, the job queue was at one time a washing line (clothes line) from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job priority.[citation needed] An improvement was the Atlas Supervisor. Introduced with the Manchester Atlas in 1962, it is considered by many to be the first recognisable modern operating system. Brinch Hansen described it as "the most significant breakthrough in the history of operating systems."

                        <i><b>Microsoft Windows</b></i> was first released in 1985, as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS, which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the time. In 1995, Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstrap. For backwards compatibility, Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows 3.x drivers. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last version in the Win9x family. Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel. Current client versions of Windows run on IA-32, x86-64 and 32-bit ARM microprocessors. In addition Itanium is still supported in older server version Windows Server 2008 R2. In the past, Windows NT supported additional architectures.
                           Server editions of Windows are widely used. In recent years, Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system. However, Windows' usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market share.

                        <i><strong>macOS</strong></i> (formerly "Mac OS X" and later "OS X") is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc., the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computers. macOS is the successor to the original classic Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. Unlike its predecessor, macOS is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 1997. The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0, followed in March 2001 by a client version (Mac OS X v10.0 "Cheetah"). Since then, six more distinct "client" and "server" editions of macOS have been released, until the two were merged in OS X 10.7 "Lion".
                        Prior to its merging with macOS, the server edition – macOS Server – was architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart and usually ran on Apple's line of Macintosh server hardware. macOS Server included work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services, including a mail transfer agent, a Samba server, an LDAP server, a domain name server, and others. With Mac OS X v10.7 Lion, all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been integrated into the client version and the product re-branded as "OS X" (dropping "Mac" from the name). The server tools are now offered as an application

                        <i><strong>Linux </strong></i> kernel originated in 1991, as a project of Linus Torvalds, while a university student in Finland. He posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmers, and received support and assistance from volunteers who succeeded in creating a complete and functional kernel.
Linux is Unix-like, but was developed without any Unix code, unlike BSD and its variants. Because of its open license model, the Linux kernel code is available for study and modification, which resulted in its use on a wide range of computing machinery from supercomputers to smart-watches. Although estimates suggest that Linux is used on only 1.82% of all "desktop" (or laptop) PCs,[15] it has been widely adopted for use in servers[16] and embedded systems[17] such as cell phones. Linux has superseded Unix on many platforms and is used on most supercomputers including the top 385.[18] Many of the same computers are also on Green500 (but in different order), and Linux runs on the top 10. Linux is also commonly used on other small energy-efficient computers, such as smartphones and smartwatches. The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Google's Android, Chrome OS, and Chromium OS.

        <h4>Other Operating systems</h4>
        <p>
            There have been many operating systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets and continue to be developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research. Another example is the Oberon System designed at ETH Zürich by Niklaus Wirth, Jürg Gutknecht and a group of students at the former Computer Systems Institute in the 1980s. It was used mainly for research, teaching, and daily work in Wirth's group.
            Other operating systems have failed to win significant market share, but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating systems, not least Bell Labs' Plan 9.

                        <strong>A real-time operating system (RTOS)</strong> is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. A real-time system is a time-bound system which has well-defined, fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. They either are event-driven or time-sharing. Event-driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities, while time-sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. Most RTOSs use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.
                        A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's task; the variability is 'jitter'. A 'hard' real-time operating system has less jitter than a 'soft' real-time operating system. The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS.

        <p>
            An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling. Scheduler flexibility enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities, but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.
            See the comparison of real-time operating systems for a comprehensive list. Also, see the list of operating systems for all types of operating systems. 
        </p>
        <hr size=2 noshade>
        <h4>Design philosophies</h4>
        <p>
            An RTOS is an operating system in which the time taken to process an input stimulus is less than the time lapsed until the next input stimulus of the same type.
        </p>
        <h5>The most common designs are:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Event-driven – switches tasks only when an event of higher priority needs servicing; called preemptive priority, or priority scheduling.
            <li>Time-sharing – switches tasks on a regular clocked interrupt, and on events; called round robin.
        </ul>
        <p>
            Time sharing designs switch tasks more often than strictly needed, but give smoother multitasking, giving the illusion that a process or user has sole use of a machine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early CPU designs needed many cycles to switch tasks during which the CPU could do nothing else useful. For example, with a 20 MHz 68000 processor (typical of the late 1980s), task switch times are roughly 20 microseconds. In contrast, a 100 MHz ARM CPU (from 2008) switches in less than 3 microseconds. Because switching took so long, early OSes tried to minimize wasting CPU time by avoiding unnecessary task switching.
